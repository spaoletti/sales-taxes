# sales-taxes

You can verify the three main test cases by launching the `main` method (`Main` class)
or by executing the tests (specifically the `GivenTestCases` class).

The project was written with Java 18, but I didn't use any syntax specific of that 
version, so you can use a previous version if you want to.

I made a commit for every green test, so you can follow the evolution of the design.

Happy reviewing and good holidays
